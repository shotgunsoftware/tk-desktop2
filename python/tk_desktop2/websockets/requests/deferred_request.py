    Wrapper around a :class:`WebsocketsRequest` which serves as a broker between
    the request runner and the :class:`WebsocketsRequest`.

    Certain websocket commands require a full state of commands and configurations
    prior to execution. The external_config interface which is part of shotgunutils
    is fully asynchronous and will provide any external data as soon as it has
    access to it.

    This class provides a buffer which builds up a full configuration state so that
    Toolkit WebsocketsRequest are only executed once a full external state, covering
    all different pipeline configurations, has been loaded.
