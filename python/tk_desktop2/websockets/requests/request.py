    Base class that represents a web sockets request.

    Requests are created via the `WebsocketsRequest.create` factory classmethod
    and each different command supported by the engine is represented by a class.

    The following requests are currently supported:

    - get_actions - list Toolkit actions.
    - execute_action - execute Toolkit action.
    - pick_file_or_directory - select single item.
    - pick_files_or_directories - select multiple items.
    - open - open a file on disk.
